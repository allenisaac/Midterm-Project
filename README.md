# Midterm-Project
midterm project for MA 415

Original data is in the "Raw Data folder"

"Combination.R" takes care of all of the cleaning and saves the 4 "Reduced Data" files, 2 csv and 2 rds.  

"Presentation.Rmd" is the markdown code for the presentation, which goes through the entire "Combination.R" process, as well as the "Graph.R".
"Graph.R" is the code for the graphs and the summary statistics.
